/**
 * OutputBuffer — bounded in-memory capture of one process stream.
 *
 * Newest output is always retained; when the retained size exceeds the cap,
 * whole chunks are evicted from the head and counted in `truncatedBytes`.
 * A single chunk larger than the cap itself is trimmed to its tail (on a
 * UTF-8 boundary) so retention is strictly bounded even for one giant write.
 * An optional spill callback receives every chunk (in order, before any
 * eviction) so the caller can keep a complete on-disk copy.
 *
 * Plain TS by design: this is push-based accumulation driven by node stream
 * 'data' callbacks, not stream transformation.
